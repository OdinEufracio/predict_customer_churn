# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description
In this project, we will build a machine learning model to predict customer churn. We will use the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains 7043 rows and 21 columns. Each row represents a customer, each column contains customer’s attributes described on the column Metadata. The raw data contains 7043 rows (customers) and 21 columns (features). The “Churn” column is our target.

## Files and data description
- `data`: This folder contains the `bank_data.csv` file, which contains the raw data.
- `images`: This folder contains the images generated.
- `models`: This folder contains the trained models.
- `logs`: This folder contains the logs generated.
- `requirements_py3.6.txt`: This file contains the required libraries to run the code.
- `churn_notebook.ipynb`: Base or initial notebook
- `churn_library.py`: This file contains improved functions used in the notebook.
- `churn_script_logging_and_tests.py`: This file contains functions to tests and logs the `churn_library.py` functions. 

## Running Files

To run the tests and logs, run the following command:

```bash
python churn_script_logging_and_tests.py
```
After running the tests
- the logs will be saved in the `logs` folder
- the images will be saved in the `images` folder
- the trained models will be saved in the `models` folder
